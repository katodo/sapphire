[bot]
server: localhost
#	This is the adress, where the moonraker of the desired printer is located at. 
#	In most cases it will be 'localhost'. Alternatively, an ip:port, as in 192.168.0.19:7125 can be entered, 
#	if you are running multiple moonraker instances on the machine, or if the bot is located not on the printer itself.
bot_token: 2026922295:AAEqpdXJ_x8BHLIbLLqdxPoiBvCIYGBdV1E
#	This is the bot token, the most important part of every bot. 
#	You get it when you create a new bot. To create a new bot, you have to talk to @BotFather in telegram. 
#	The only thing you need is the token, the rest is taken care of by the chat_id.
#	Only the chat with the correct chat_id can send/receive commands to the bot.
chat_id: 111206798
#	This is the ID of the chat, where the bot is supposed to be able to send updates to. 
#	To get the ID, after creating a new bot write something to this bot, then navigate to 
#	https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_token>/getUpdates you will see json with information about your message, sent to the bot. 
#	Find chat_id there.
#socks_proxy: 192.168.0.22:1080
#	If needed, you can configure the bot to use a socks5 proxy. 
#user: root
#	If you have moonraker authorization enabled, you can enter the user and password here.
#	My advice is to not expose your printer to the internet, but I am not your mother.
#password: qwerty
#	The password is stored in plain text.
#light_device: leds
#	This is the power device in moonraker, to which the lights of the printer/chamber are connected to.
#	If you do not have lights/have no need to cycle them, skip this parameter.
#	Default is to omit this.
#power_device: power
#	This is the power device in moonraker, to which the power of the printer slave boards are connected to.
#	A typical usage scenario is to shutdown power to the MCUs, but not to disable the host on which klipper is running.
#	If you do not have such a setup, skip this.
#	Default is to omit this.
#debug: true
#	This enables extensive logging. Only use it for debugging/troubleshooting.
#	Default is to omit this/false.
log_path: /tmp
#log_path: /home/max_xxv/klipper_logs
#	You can change the path for the logfiles. The default behaviour is to place them under /tmp.
#	On a typical installation this would mean, that logs get cleared on a reboot.
#	You can choose another location, if needed.
#eta_source: slicer
#	You can choose, which value to use for remaining time estimation.
#	Values avaliable: slicer, file
#	Default value is slicer.
#sensors: mcu, ..., ...
#	You can add temperature sensors, like the "mcu" sensor to be displayed in the status message. 
#	Simply enter the names from your klipper config, separated by commas.
#	Default is not to display any additional temperature sensors.
#heaters: extruder, heater_bed
#	You can add heaters, like the extruder, or the bed to be displayed in the status message. 
#	Simply enter the names from your klipper config, separated by commas.
#	Default is not to display any additional heaters. 




[camera]
host: http://localhost:8080/?action=stream
#	This is the adress, where the desired webcam/webstream is located at. Enter this the same way you enter it in 
#	your printers web interface/your player. If you can stream it, the bot supports it, native h264 streams,
#	for example a vlc stream from a runcam webcam is absolutely possible. Do not feel contstrained by mjpeg streams.
flipVertically: false
#	You can flip the camera image vertically, if needed. Disabled by default. Set to true if needed.
flipHorizontally: false
#	You can flip the camera image horizontally, if needed. Disabled by default. Set to true if needed.
#fourcc: x264
#	You can change the opencv VideoWriter fourcc codec. The default value is 'x264'.
# 	An alternative is mp4v for playback on specific apple devices, or if the machine which is going to do
#	the encoding is very weak.
#threads: 2 
#	You may limit the threads used for image processing. Default value is calculalated, (os.cpu_count() / 2)
videoDuration: 15
#	This is the length in seconds of the video, which is sent when requested with /video command. 
#	Default length of a video is 5 seconds
#light_control_timeout: 2
#	When the bot toggles lights to take a picture, or record a video, most cameras need a couple of seconds to adjust to 
#	the transition between full darkness and full brightness. This option tells the bot to wait n seconds, before
#	taking the picture, recording a video, doing timelapse photos. The default is not to use a delay.
#picture_quality: low
#	This parameter controls the picture quality the bot uses for status and timelapse purposes. 
#	Valid parameters are "low", "high". Low uses jpeg with quality set to 80, high uses losless webp.
#	Default is "high"


[progress_notification]
#percent: 5
#	This is an interval in percent, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 5, notifications are sent at 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.
#	When set to 3, notifications are sent at 3%, 6%, 9%, etc.
#	The default is not to send notifications based on print percentage.
#height: 5
#	This is an interval in mm, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 5, notifications are sent at 5mm, 10mm, 15mm, etc, print height.
#	When set to 3, notifications are sent at 3mm, 6mm, 9mm, etc, print height
#	The default is not to send notifications based on print height.
time: 120
#	This is an interval in seconds, when a notification with a picture is sent to the chat.
#	When set to 600, notifications are sent at 600 seconds, 1200 seconds, 1800 seconds, etc, print time.
#	When set to 100, notifications are sent at 100 seconds, 200 seconds, 300 seconds, etc, print time.
#	The default is not to send notifications based on time.
#	This type of notifications continues, even when the print is paused. So if your printer triggers a pause, for example 
#	caused by filament runout, you will still get notifications regularly, until the print is completed/canceled.  
#groups: group_id_1, group_id_2
#	When running multiple printers/a farm, you may want to aggregate all notifications from all printers in a group.
#	You can enter group IDs here, to which notifications will be sent. No control from a group is possible.
#	Only notifications are sent.


[timelapse]
cleanup: true
#	Should the bot clean the catalog with pictures and video after the successful sending to the telegram chat.
#	Default is true. You might want to set it to false, if you intend on using the pictures later.
#height: 0.2
#	The bot can take timelapse pictures based on the z axis height. The default is not to take pictures based on height.
#	Your layer height should be a multiple/equal to this number.
#time: 5
#	The bot can take timelapse pictures based on time intervals in seconds. 
#	The default is not to take pictures based on time intervals.
target_fps: 15  
#	This is the target fps of the created video. The larger this number, the "faster" the timelapse will be.
#	15 fps equals 15 images per second lapsing. The default is 15 fps.
min_lapse_duration: 5
#	On short prints, or with limited lapse pictures available, the lapse often gets to short to meaningfully display
#	the printing progress. You can specify the desired minimum duration of the created timelapse 
#	(not including last_frame_duration). This means, that the fps will get reduced, if the lapse is shorter than this time.
#	The default is to omit this.
#max_lapse_duration: 5
#	Similar to min_lapse_duration, if your lapse video gets too long to watch, you can specify a desired time, which
#	should not be exceeded. This means, that the fps will get increased, if the lapse is going to be longer than this time.
#	The default is to omit this. 
last_frame_duration: 15
#	This allows you to prevent the timelapse video from ending too abruptly. You can choose a duration for which 
#	to loop the last picture taken.
#	Default is 5 seconds. 
#manual_mode: false
#	if True, only commands from gcode will manage timelapse.
#	Default is false.


[telegram_ui]
#hidden_methods: /bot_restart
#	This allows you to hide unused buttons from your bots keyboard. A good example is the bot_restart command - 
#	after you are finished configuring everything, you propably don't need the command as a key on the keyboard.
#	This does not disable the command - you can still run the command by typing it into the chat
#custom_buttons: /my_super_button, /my_second_button
#	This allows you to add your own custom macros to the bot's keyboard. The macro listed in this section
#	should be defined in klipper config files, in UPPERCASE. Maximum macro name length is 54 chars.
#	Useful to add a button for a filament change, for homing, for axis movement, etc.
#require_confirmation_macro: false
#	This flag makes the bot confirm, if you want to run a macro, similar to the check which happens 
#	with the "/shutdown" command.
#silent_progress: true
#	Sends the progress message (%/mm if configured) without an alert. You still get a "red" notification, 
#	but it does not have sound or vibration.
#	Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. There is no way to work around that. 
#	Default is false.
silent_commands: true
#	Sends all other messages (for example the emergency stop confirmation) without an alert.You still get a "red" notification, 
#	but it does not have sound or vibration.
#	Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. There is no way to work around that. 
#	Default is false.
silent_status: true
#	Sendsthe status message (printer status) without an alert. You still get a "red" notification, 
#	but it does not have sound or vibration.
#	Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. There is no way to work around that. 
#	Default is false.
